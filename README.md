**EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS FOR TECHCORP**

**Overview**

This project aims to provide valuable insights into employee performance and productivity at TechCorp Inc., a rapidly growing company facing challenges in managing its workforce. By analyzing employee behaviour, departmental performance, and overall trends, this analysis supports decision-making in areas such as training, resource allocation, and recruitment. The goal is to provide unbiased, data-driven recommendations to improve employee satisfaction, efficiency, and reduce overwork.

**Tasks**

**1. Data Import and Initial Exploration**

•	Loaded the dataset and displayed the first few rows to understand its structure.

•	Summarized data types and identified columns with missing values.

**2. Data Cleaning**
   
•	Handled missing values by applying appropriate strategies (e.g., mean for numeric columns, mode for categorical).

•	Identified and handled outliers that could skew the analysis (e.g., unusually high monthly hours).

•	Ensured correct representation of categorical variables (e.g., Department, Job Role).

**4. Feature Engineering**

•	Created a new column, 'Overworked', flagging employees who work over 220 hours per month.

•	Generated an 'Efficiency Score', calculated as the ratio of 'Projects Completed' to 'Monthly Hours'.

**5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

•	Provided insights into employee distribution across departments and job roles.

•	Visualized the average satisfaction score by department to identify areas needing attention.

•	Compared efficiency scores across job roles to identify the highest-performing roles.

**6. Conclusions and Recommendations**

•	Based on the analysis, provided actionable insights for improving employee performance and satisfaction.

•	Suggested strategies for reducing overwork and boosting employee satisfaction in certain departments.
